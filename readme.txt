== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is content copywriting? =

Copywriting involves crafting persuasive written content with the goal of driving a specific action or response from the reader. It typically focuses on marketing or advertising purposes and requires an understanding of the target audience, as well as clear and engaging language. 

= What is rewriting, editing and the difference between them ? =

Editing involves reviewing and making changes to an existing piece of writing in order to improve its clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness. This can involve correcting grammar and spelling errors, reorganizing sentences or paragraphs for better flow, and polishing the language to make it more engaging for the reader.

Rewriting, on the other hand, involves revising the content of a piece of writing more extensively. This can include making substantial changes to the structure, tone, or focus of the piece in order to improve its overall quality and effectiveness.

While editing may involve some rewriting, the two processes are not necessarily interchangeable. Editing may focus more on fine-tuning and polishing an already-existing piece of writing, while rewriting involves making more substantive changes to the content itself.

= How do I get an OpenAI API key? =

You can retrieve an OpenAI API key by signing up on the OpenAI website at https://platform.openai.com/signup.

= Is OpenAI free? =

OpenAI offers a simple and flexible pricing model. You only pay for what you use. For more information on OpenAI's pricing, please visit https://openai.com/pricing.

= How do I generate AI content? =

To create new content with Aiify Blocks, simply add Aiify Block to your page, post, or any Block editor active post type. You can then use our preconfigured prompts or write your own perfect prompt, and then click the "write" button.

= How can I customize the generated content? =

When selecting the Aiify Block or any Aiify Enhanced Block, you'll see customization options in the editor's side panel. From there, you can adjust the maximum words, tone, and style.

= Is this plugin compatible with the classic editor =

Sorry, for now, this plugin is only usable via the block editor (Gutenberg). It can't be used to write and edit content in the classic editor. However, it can be used in Full Site Editor if your theme is FSE compatible.
